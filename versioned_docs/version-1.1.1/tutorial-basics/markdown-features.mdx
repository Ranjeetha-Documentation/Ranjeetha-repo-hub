# RDK Video

The RDK Video platform, detailing its key features and functionalities:

You can find an overview of the RDK Video platform, detailing its key features and functionalities at 
[RDK Video Documentation](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK+Video+Documentation)

**Application Development:**

Developers interested in RDK application development using Firebolt
®
can refer

security features in the RDK, please refer
[RDK Security](https://wiki.rdkcentral.com/display/RDK/RDK-Security)
.
**Firebolt
®
1.0(Ripple) -**
Firebolt® 1.0 (Ripple) streamlines RDK app integration with standardized rules. Ripple, its open-source Rust-based Application gateway, facilitates dynamic extensions and serves as a Firebolt® Gateway. RDK 6 is Firebolt® 1.0-certified, with a comprehensive test suite for compliance.

**Security -**
The Application Platform Layer ensures robust security with Dobby-managed
**containerization**
, leveraging Linux kernel features for process isolation.
**Downloadable Application Containers (DAC)**
enable secure running of binary applications on STBs without modification, ensuring compatibility across RDK 6 devices. Access Control is enforced through
**AppArmor**
, a proactive Linux security system. RDKM's open-sourced AppArmor profile generator tool for RDK 6 provides fine-grained control over process resources, contributing to a secure environment.

## Middleware

Serving as a vital bridge between the Application Platform Layer and the hardware(HAL), the RDK Middleware Layer incorporates essential components that are pivotal for the seamless operation of the RDK platform.
Core to this layer are
**RDK services**
, providing JSON-RPC services for interactive applications.
In the realm of security,
**iCrypto**
handles critical cryptographic operations, ensuring secure communication and data protection.
**Rialto**
offers a secure solution for AV pipelines in containerized applications, and the
**Window Manager**
orchestrates GUI layout.
**Device management**
enables streamlined operations in RDK deployments, including bulk operations and firmware downloads. XCONF integration revolutionizes code downloads for a smoother deployment experience. Log uploads aid comprehensive debugging, offering insights into system performance. RDK Feature Control (RFC) enables dynamic feature management for enhanced flexibility. Telemetry systematically collects essential data insights, while WebPA ensures secure communication between cloud servers and RDK devices. The Media Player, crucial for local rendering devices, manages various pipeline functions, supporting IP and QAM playback. The
**Open Content Decryption Module(OCDM)**
enforces Digital Rights Management (DRM) policies. Together with other RDK elements, these components ensure the efficient and secure functioning of the RDK platform.

## HAL

In the RDK video stack, the HAL Layer(Hardware Abstraction Layer) plays a vital role in facilitating communication between the video application software and hardware components like the GPU, video encoding/decoding hardware, and audio devices. It provides a standardized framework for functions, data structures, and protocols, enabling efficient hardware resource utilization. The HAL layer manages
